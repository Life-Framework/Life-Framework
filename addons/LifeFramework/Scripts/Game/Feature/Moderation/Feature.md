# Moderation - Design Requirements

Admins rule from facts, not two players' stories. `LF_IncidentLog` records deaths,
sampled player-on-player damage, and cash moves on the server only, as a subscriber
on `LF_EventBus` (`docs/architecture/events.md`). It is bounded by config, saved in
the `incidents` payload, and never replicated. Query by position and time window.
See `docs/features.md`.
